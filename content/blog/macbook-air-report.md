A new report said earlier this week that Apple is working on a brand new laptop. Apple plans to release a 15-inch MacBook Air in 2024, a first for the Air series. A trusted Apple insider with a proven track record confirmed that Apple is working on the larger MacBook Air.

However, Apple might not include it in the Air series when it launches it. As for the notebook's release date, the 15-inch MacBook isn't coming soon. It'll get a late 2024 release at best, according to the new claims.

## What sizes do MacBook Airs come in?

Apple currently sells only one MacBook Air size. The laptop comes in a 13-inch version that matches the pre-2021 13-inch MacBook Pro size. Previously, Apple sold an 11-inch MacBook Air, but the company discontinued that model in 2017.
