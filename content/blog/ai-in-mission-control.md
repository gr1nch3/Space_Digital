Artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing how mission control teams operate and respond to challenges during space missions.

## Predictive Maintenance

AI systems now predict equipment failures before they occur, allowing for preventative maintenance and reducing mission risks.

## Autonomous Decision Making

In situations where communication delays make Earth-based decisions impractical, AI systems can make critical decisions autonomously.

## Data Processing Optimization

The massive amounts of data transmitted from space missions are now processed and analyzed by AI systems in a fraction of the time it would take human teams.
